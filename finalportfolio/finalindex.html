                        <p>This assignment requires a browser-based design using p5.js that employs the system clock’s three basic events (seconds, minutes, and hours). This was my first time completing a program with JavaScript. </p>
                        <p>My clock design is inspired by the traditional clock shape, consisting of four circles representing the day, hour, minute, and second. The smaller time units rotate around the larger ones, visually highlighting the passage of time. When the seconds exceed 57, the color of its circle turns red. The background color changes depending on whether it is morning or afternoon.</p>

                        <p>I collaborated with Kelly to design an IFTTT tool aimed at cheering people up on Monday mornings when they often feel down about heading to school or work. At the user’s set time, a cute Samoyed dog appears in the phone's widget to lift their spirits.</p>

                        <p>This semester began and ended with generative design. For my final project, I used JavaScript to randomly generate shapes of varying sizes and colors. When the left mouse button is pressed, circles of different sizes are created, while pressing the mouse wheel generates squares of various sizes. Both shapes have a level of transparency, allowing them to overlap and form colorful, gem-like patterns.</p>

            <p>WEEK2: Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts</p>
            <p>Ulises Carrión critiques that Mail Art is not simply about sending postcards and emphasizes that Mail Art uses the postal system as a support for artistic expression, not as its medium. He highlights the tension between the artist's control over the creation of Mail Art and the constraints of the postal system, holding the opinion that Mail Art transcends traditional mail functions and should be understood as an artistic medium rather than merely a form of communication. Based on the text, I am wondering to what extent the structural limitations and bureaucratic constraints of the postal system influence mail art. Also, can these constraints (the no control of the actual posting) be considered integral to the art form, or do they simply restrict artistic freedom?</p>

                When I read the sections, the most impressive sentence was "The web is called the web because its vitality depends on just that — an interconnected web of individual nodes breathing life into a vast network. " I usually think of the web as a public thing, but I never realized that the public is actually made up of individuals.

                How do we express ourselves through personal websites when social apps dominate the digital world?

                When we create personal websites as a form of art, are we creating them for ourselves, or are we creating them to present to the public?

            <p>
                As a historic preservation student, I found the text quite impactful. Although websites and web pages exist in a digital form, it is essential to recognize their significance and historical value. They can provide valuable insights into the history of the internet and reflect broader social changes. It is a pity to see how much data has been lost as these pages became outdated or “aged,” which ultimately compromises their integrity. Physical preservation and digital preservation might be different but the same in principle.

                What does the “aging” of Geocities pages reveal about the history and culture of the internet?

                Can these aging websites be considered part of our digital heritage?

                The text emphasizes the concept of visual literacy and the importance of understanding visual communication in the context of a rapidly changing media landscape. Visual language arises from the connections and background of the graphics rather than from the signs in isolation. Therefore, I questioned:

                1.  Language and text may contain biases or barriers to understanding. Do graphics share similar characteristics? If so, do they also require interpretation to avoid misunderstanding?

                2.  How does the idea of "the whole is a new thing, completely separate from any sum of its parts" work well in design and visual communication?

                It was impressive to read about the difference between analogue and digital publishing. Though digital publishing integrates multiple formats, I still get used to the tactile and physical qualities of printed materials. While digital publishing is becoming more user-friendly, the experience of reading a physical book is deeply ingrained in print culture. This may change in our next generation.

                1. What are the potential challenges and limitations of hybrid publishing models that combine digital and print elements, and how might these affect the sustainability of both formats in the long term?

                2. Since the digital world is becoming more significant, how does this affect the future of print publishing as a medium of expression? Are digital and physical formats conflict?

                When I firstly saw the webpage "https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/" I felt it does not look great in terms of the color scheme and layout. After reading through the text, I then realized the meaning of alt-text. The text emphasizes the importance of alt-text not just as a functional tool for accessibility, but as a creative and expressive medium. It encourages writers to view alt-text through a poetic lens, highlighting its potential for translation and representation. The workbook also suggests that it can enrich both the creator's and the viewer's experience.
                How can the poetic approach to alt-text enhance the accessibility of digital content for diverse audiences? For people who have a visual impairment, how can alt-text transfer the correct meaning without using words that create ambiguity?
                In what ways can the subjective nature of alt-text impact the representation of marginalized identities?

            <p>
                It is interesting to explore the idea of decolonizing the digital world, and this is the first time I've realized just how dominant English is in coding. I know there’s a platform called "Scratch" that teaches children coding logic through puzzles globally, and it makes me wonder if similar approaches could be adapted for speakers of other languages. However, the core of coding still relies heavily on English.

                1. I am not optimistic about the future of decolonizing the digital world, as most platforms, software, and plug-ins are based on English coding frameworks. Is it even feasible to abandon all these existing structures and create a new one?

                2. What strategies could be used to facilitate effective communication across language barriers in programming, creating a more equitable environment for non-English-speaking developers? Is it possible to develop a coding language independent of human languages? How can we make sure that such a language avoids any built-in inequalities?

            <p>WEEK10: New Modernism(s)</p>
            <p>
                Duvall explores the evolution of graphic design through modernism, postmodernism, and "hypermodernism." It emphasizes the significance of surfaces and signs in graphic design and how these have changed from tangible, one-to-one associations to complex, interconnected symbols. Duvall also discusses how graphic design serves as a reflection of cultural shifts and technological progress  in digital world.

                1. The use of Disney imagery is discussed as a form of critique against capitalist structures. What other contemporary symbols could be used similarly in critical design, and what challenges might arise from their use?

                2. Duvall argues that the surface is no longer neutral and plays an active role in informing content. How does this idea change our understanding of the relationship between form and content in design?

            <p>WEEK12: Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games</p>
            <p>
                Frenkel’s work serves as an exploration of the limitations and implications of early digital media. String Games includes what Tuer describes as a “poetics of absence,” revealing the loss in mediated connections. The absence here isn't merely of presence but suggests a deeper narrative loss—memory, interactivity, and history undergo transformation through digital media's ephemeral nature.

                1. Is digital media inherently disruptive to our understanding of memory and history?

                2. Does Frenkel's framing of telepresence as “loss” suggest limitations of technology in creating real human connection?

            <p>WEEK13: Performing the Feed</p>
            <p>
                Paul Soulellis explores the evolution of publishing from physical practices to algorithm-driven feeds. The "new boredom" concept shows the paradox of passive consumption coupled with active surveillance. The feed, as a seemingly endless flow of content, challenges traditional notions of authorship and public engagement. An interesting point from the text is the distinction between the post and the feed. Soulellis argues that while the post demands attention through interruption, the feed subtly envelops us, blurring the lines between public and private, human and algorithmic authorship. This raises questions about our role as consumers and creators within these systems and the ethical implications of our increasing reliance on algorithmic curation.

                1. How can we resist the "smooth flow" of the feed to foster critical engagement with the content we consume?
                2. If authorship is becoming increasingly non-human and fluid, what are the implications for accountability and trust in digital spaces?

            <p>WEEK14: Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons</p>
            <p>
                It is interesting to read the story of how technology shapes human relationships, history, and identity. The story tells us to treat technology as a tool for fostering connection, creativity, and social equity. Ultimately, it underscores the idea that technology should serve humanity, enhancing our collective potential rather than replicating systems of control and exploitation. It reminds us of the importance of community and imagination in resisting these forces and reimagining technology as a tool for empowerment and connection rather than domination. It reminds me of a reading we did several weeks ago, which discussed why dominant programming languages are predominantly based in English.

                1. How can we design and implement technological systems that actively reject oppressive histories and foster inclusivity, especially for marginalized communities?

                2. If we redesign the system, will it become easier or more difficult for all users to understand or manipulate?

            <p>WEEK15: Art on the Internet</p>
            <p>
                Boris Groys explores the impact of the Internet on art and literature. The Internet not only transforms the way art is disseminated but also blurs the boundaries between fiction and reality in traditional art presentation, leading to the "de-fictionalization" of art. Art is no longer a static work displayed in museums or galleries but a continuous, real-time process.

                1. The article mentions the shift of the artist's identity from localized to global, but the Internet doesn't always reflect the real world. Does the Internet show greater transparency or contribute more to confusion and the spread of rumors?

                2. Can the Internet be considered a form of decentralization?
